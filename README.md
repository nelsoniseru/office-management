Every Real Estate brokerage has some of the same problems! So many agents are hired per month that it's hard to keep up with everything that needs to be done! That's where this system comes in to play!

It starts with simple task management. Whether you're sending a welcome email or reminding someone their real estate license is about to expire. All can be done with a few clicks of a button!

- React w/ Hooks and Redux for State Management. Front end broken into microservices for improved speed and efficiency. 
- JWT Authorization with protected/private routes for authorized user only.
- Node/Express backend with MongoDB for data storage. CRUD Methods with REST API.
